### A Fork of Robocode for python programming


### Installation
* [Python 2.7 Windows 64bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.16/python2716.chm)
* [Pyqt4.exe](https://netcologne.dl.sourceforge.net/project/pyqt/PyQt4/PyQt-4.11.4/PyQt4-4.11.4-gpl-Py2.7-Qt4.8.7-x64.exe)
 

### Bots
 - StevoJDbot
 - Center
 - Wall


### StevoJDbot
 - The movement is circle motion.
 - Head on targeting system that has system that can control power of shot and recoil.
 
 
### Center
 - This bot is designed to move to the center of the arena.
 - Calculates the distance and the angle and moves the bot.
Unfortunately the bot does not work as it won't turn the tank in the correct direction.

### Wall
 - Bot that detects walls 
 As there is no speed/velocity. 
 I did try *-1 of the direction this did work but then the main loop would start again.
